   * adds overhead.

   * or fast enough not to benefit from it; while
   * `fromExecutor` and `fromExecutorService` do NOT add
   * this optimization since they don't know whether the underlying
   * executor will benefit from it.
   * A batching executor can create deadlocks if code does
   * not use `scala.concurrent.blocking` when it should,
   * because tasks created within other tasks will block
   * on the outer task completing.
