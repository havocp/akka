/*
 * Locking rules:
 *
 * While not suspendSwitch, messages are processed (!isActive) or queued
 * thread-locally (isActive). While suspendSwitch, messages are queued
 * thread-locally. When resuming, all messages are atomically scooped from all
 * non-active threads and queued on the resuming thread's queue, to be
 * processed immediately. Processing a queue checks suspend before each
 * invocation, leaving the active state if suspendSwitch. For this to work
 * reliably, the active flag needs to be set atomically with the initial check
 * for suspend. Scooping up messages means replacing the ThreadLocal's contents
 * with an empty new NestingQueue.
 *
 * All accesses to the queue must be done under the suspendSwitch-switch's lock, so
 * within one of its methods taking a closure argument.

/**
 * Dispatcher which runs invocations on the current thread only. This
 * dispatcher does not create any new threads, but it can be used from
 * different threads concurrently for the same actor. The dispatch strategy is
 * to run on the current thread unless the target actor is either suspendSwitch or
 * already running on the current thread (if it is running on a different
 * thread, then this thread will block until that other invocation is
 * finished); if the invocation is not run, it is queued in a thread-local
 * queue to be executed once the active invocation further up the call stack
 * finishes. This leads to completely deterministic execution order if only one
 * thread is used.
 *
 * Suspending and resuming are global actions for one actor, meaning they can
 * affect different threads, which leads to complications. If messages are
 * queued (thread-locally) during the suspendSwitch period, the only thread to run
 * them upon resume is the thread actually calling the resume method. Hence,
 * all thread-local queues which are not currently being drained (possible,
 * since suspend-queue-resume might happen entirely during an invocation on a
 * different thread) are scooped up into the current thread-local queue which
 * is then executed. It is possible to suspend an actor from within its call
 * stack.
